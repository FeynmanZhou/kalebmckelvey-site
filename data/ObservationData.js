    actually have the full plan ready results in better focus to grow
    the plan, or the fail fast mentality of projects you don't
    actually enjoy - meaning you don't spend a bunch of time planning
    for something you find out you dislike.`

    happiness you have doesn't come in spikes. Instead, they are like
    compound interest, gradually growing into the high levels you
    eventually see. This gives more reason to not procrastinate, but
    break down big tasks into smaller daily ones (like do 1 hour of
    training a day vs 4 on Friday).`
