# Kaleb McKevely's Material Design Personal Portfolio / Blog

Open source Gatsby project that allowed me to migrate from WordPress. I did this to explore React, GraphQL, Material Design, and Markdown (Tech details mentioned below).

I took advantage of [Gatsby Material Starter](https://github.com/Vagr9K/gatsby-material-starter) for my foundation, then added / changed as needed. Checkout his repo to learn how to utilize the start for your own blog!

## Tech Stack
