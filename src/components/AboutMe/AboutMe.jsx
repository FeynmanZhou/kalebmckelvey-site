            {/* Story! */}
            <h1>My Story</h1>
            <p>I believe everyone has a wonderful story to explain how in the world they got to the current moment we call now. Here's a bit of mine!</p>
            <h2>TLDR:</h2>
            <p>
              I&apos;m Kaleb McKelvey, a small town raised young professional who focuses on exhibiting high character
              combined with strong ambition to continously grow a little bit each day.<br />
              <br />
              I&apos;ve been working at General Electric for ~4 years with experiences in both leadership and technical
              depth, molding me into a well rounded Software Engineer who has a true passion for technology!
            </p>
            <h2>Long Version</h2>
            <p>
              I&apos;m a young professional with aspirations to inspire, grow, and achieve in various areas of my life.
            </p>
            <h3>Small town life</h3>
            <p>Growing up in a small town built the foundation of who I am today in a few ways.</p>
            <p>
              First, and most important, my family instilled in me the values of responsibility, character, and
              integrity.Â  Second, my coaches and teachers taught me the values of work ethic and accountability. Lastly,
              it gave me the opportunity to understand that boredom can be replaced with canoe trips down the river,
              swimming in the quarry, and learning new technologies!
            </p>
            <h3>College Years</h3>
            <p>Technology for me began with video games, leading to a desire for becoming a developer.</p>
            <p>
              It was this desire that my college journey began, a journey that changed my perspective by opening my mind
              and meeting great people with unique stories. A place to learn how to program from experts and the skill
              of time management through balance.
            </p>
            <p>
              By graduation, I completed my dream of learning to develop and became a member of the greatest fraternity
              in the world, Kappa Alpha Psi.
            </p>
            <p>
              My family, fraternity brothers, and colleagues guided me to a new vision on life, one that looks at the
              future as much as the present.
            </p>
            <h3>Becoming a Software Engineer!</h3>
            <p>
              Since then, I began working at GE in their Digital Technology Leadership Program. Two years later,
              February 2017, I achieved my dream of becoming a software engineer! GE is a company that focuses on the
              development of both technical and leadership skill-sets. Because of this, I have grown in both my
              professional and personal worlds thanks to the fabulous people I&apos;ve met on the way.
            </p>
            <h3>Concluding Thoughts</h3>
            <p>
              Overall I am excited to grow through new experiences! My passion for technology and desire to make the
              world a better place drives me to continue learning. Life is a feeling process and a journey to achieve
              all that you want on the way!
            </p>
            <p>
              I hope to influence your journey towards achieving anything you want. I truly believe you are the
              executive of your life.
            </p>
            <p>With all that being said, I look forward to hearing from you - comment, subscribe, and enjoy!</p>
            <p>
              Best wishes,
              <br />
              <br />
              Kaleb McKelvey
