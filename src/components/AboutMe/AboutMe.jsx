            <h1>My Story</h1>
            <p>
              I&apos;m a young professional with aspirations to inspire, grow,
              and achieve in various areas of my life.
            </p>
            <h2>Small town life</h2>
            <p>
              Growing up in a small town built the foundation of who I am today
              in a few ways.
            </p>
            <p>
              First, and most important, my family instilled in me the values of
              responsibility, character, and integrity.Â  Second, my coaches and
              teachers taught me the values of work ethic and accountability.
              Lastly, it gave me the opportunity to understand that boredom can
              be replaced with canoe trips down the river, swimming in the
              quarry, and learning new technologies!
            </p>

            <h2>College Years</h2>
            <p>
              Technology for me began with video games, leading to a desire for
              becoming a developer.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was this desire that my college journey began, a journey that
              changed my perspective by opening my mind and meeting great people
              with unique stories. A place to learn how to program from experts
              and the skill of time management through balance.
            </p>
            <p>
              By graduation, I completed my dream of learning to develop and
              became a member of the greatest fraternity in the world, Kappa
              Alpha Psi.
            </p>
            <p>
              My family, fraternity brothers, and colleagues guided me to a new
              vision on life, one that looks at the future as much as the
              present.
            </p>
            <h2>Becoming a Software Engineer!</h2>
            <p>
              Since then, I began working at GE in their Digital Technology
              Leadership Program. Two years later, February 2017, I achieved my
              dream of becoming a software engineer! GE is a company that
              focuses on the development of both technical and leadership
              skill-sets. Because of this, I have grown in both my professional
              and personal worlds thanks to the fabulous people I&apos;ve met on
              the way.
            </p>
            <p>
              With that all being said, I hope to influence your journey towards
              achieving anything you want. I truly believe you are the executive
              of your life.
            </p>
