        <h1>What I Do:</h1>
        <p>
          <strong>I help solve business problems through modern custom web applications.</strong>
        </p>

          tough requirements.

          bases as I learn from mistakes, grow through experience, and heed the advice from top developers on the web!

        {/* Story! */}
        <h1>My Story</h1>
        <p>
          I believe everyone has a wonderful story to explain how in the world they got to the current moment we call
          now. Here&#39;s a bit of mine!
        </p>
        <h2>TLDR:</h2>
        <p>
          I&apos;m Kaleb McKelvey, a small town raised young professional who focuses on exhibiting high character
          combined with strong ambition to continously grow a little bit wiser each day.
          <br />
          <br />
I started my career at a small company called Shentel, followed by transit working at General Electric
          for ~4 years with experiences in both leadership and technical depth, molding me into a well rounded Software
          Engineer who has a true passion for technology!
        </p>
        <h2>Long Version</h2>
        <p>I&apos;m a young professional with aspirations to inspire, grow, and achieve in various areas of my life.</p>
        <h3>Small town life</h3>
        <p>Growing up in a small town built the foundation of who I am today in a few ways.</p>
        <p>
          First, and most important, my family instilled in me the values of responsibility, character, and integrity.Â 
          Second, my coaches and teachers taught me the values of work ethic and accountability. Lastly, it gave me the
          opportunity to understand that boredom can be replaced with canoe trips down the river, swimming in the
          quarry, and learning new technologies!
        </p>
        <h3>College Years</h3>
        <p>Technology for me began with video games, leading to a desire for becoming a developer.</p>
        <p>
          It was this desire that my college journey began, a journey that changed my perspective by opening my mind and
          meeting great people with unique stories. A place to learn how to develop software from experts and the skill
          of time management through balance.
        </p>
        <p>
          By graduation, I completed my dream of learning to develop and became a member of the greatest fraternity in
          the world, Kappa Alpha Psi.
        </p>
        <p>
          My family, fraternity brothers, and colleagues guided me to a new vision on life, one that looks at the future
          as much as the present.
        </p>
        <h3>Becoming a Software Engineer!</h3>
        <p>
          Since then, I began working at GE in their Digital Technology Leadership Program followed achieving my dream
          of becoming a Software Engineer! GE is a company that focuses on the development of both technical and
          leadership skill-sets. Because of this, I have grown in both my professional and personal worlds thanks to the
          fabulous people I&apos;ve met on the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fast forward today, I work at Northwestern Mutual - a company that has more than a century under its belt - as
          it adventures through a digital transformation. Personal finance has long been a passion of mine, so getting
          an opportunity to spend 40+ hours a week developing software to help people with that area of their Life has
          been great!
        </p>
        <h3>Concluding Thoughts</h3>
        <p>
          Overall I am excited to grow through new experiences! My passion for technology and desire to make the world a
          better place drives me to continue learning. Life is a feeling process and a journey to achieve all that you
          want on the way!
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope to influence your journey towards achieving anything you want. I truly believe you are the executive of
          your life.
        </p>
        <p>With all that being said, I look forward to hearing from you - comment, subscribe, and enjoy!</p>
        <p>
          Best wishes,
          <br />
