## Why Algorithms Matter

I previously mentioned the reasons algorithm run time is vitally important within our daily lives in [A Rule of Thumb For Calculating an Algorithms Worst Case in Big oh](https://www.kalebmckelvey.com/a-rule-of-thumb-for-calculating-an-algorithms-worst-case-in-big-oh-notation)

Here's the quote that bares repeating:

> If computers and software didn't take time to analyze and optimize the algorithms that run our daily lives, we might never actually get those directions we asked for from Google Maps, Mint might not actually refresh our account categorization, or Twitter wouldn't show the next big POTUS tweet.

> Algorithms are in the cars we drive, the TVs we watch, and buildings we enter. They are used in medical equipment and food production. UPS literally updates you on package progress throughout the delivery cycle, and Netflix takes over the US Internet bandwidth (36%) during peak viewing hours.

> These little things called algorithms are EVERYWHERE, constantly making our lives easier, faster, and more convenient."
