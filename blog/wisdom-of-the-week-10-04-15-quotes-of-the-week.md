Another weekend has flew by, as I prepare for the week it seems like I did plenty, and could have did plenty more. One accomplishment I enjoyed was cooking the [Greek Chicken Stew](http://www.budgetbytes.com/2010/05/greek-chicken-stew/).
Greek food has become my new favorite food, a bit of an upgrade from Bagel Bites.

With the weekend ending, and my week somewhat prepared for, I decided to start looking for some quotes that can encapsulate what has been on my mind this weekend and set the tone ahead.

I hope this family wisdom of the week encourages you to call or tell your family you love them this week.

## Family Wisdom Quote 1

**"Sticking with your family is what makes it a family."** - Mitch Albom

After enjoying an awesome trip to Michigan (spoiler post alert), this was my first weekend back in Milwaukee in about a month. Without the new place motivation of going to explore, and my sister moving to Florida, I realized how much I missed being able to easily see my family. To me family isn't just who we share DNA with, I include those who we treat as though they are.

The people who forgive your mistakes, the people we can see years later and nothing changes, the people we share memories with, and the people we would really do anything for. It can be tough not being able to witness your nephew enjoying a new state, or not seeing your niece and cousins as they grow up too fast.

As a family we stick together, we Skype, we call, we text, we yell, we love, and we care. That's what makes us a family. Even at a distance we are all only one call away.

### Family Wisdom Quote 2

**"A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work."**\- _Colin Powell_

A new week, new goals, and new hours to take advantage of. Let's set the tone of working hard, getting over challenges, working with people, and enjoying ourselves! Our families should encourage and support us as we make our dreams a reality!

Have a great week everyone!
