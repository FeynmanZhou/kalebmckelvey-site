I wanted to share a few quotes on achievement with you this week!

## Achievement Wisdom of the Week Quote 1

"While it is always best to believe in one's self, a little help from others can be a great blessing." - Uncle Iroh

Uncle Iroh tops my favorite character list on one of my favorite shows - _Avatar the Last Air Bender._ This quote helps to humble us, because we sometimes get caught up in our pride instead of asking for help in challenges of life.

We have friends, family, mentors, and sometimes even strangers (Show plug) that can guide us on our journey. All we need to do is ask.

## Achievement Wisdom of the Week Quote 2

"Look at things as they can be, not as they are" - David J. Schwartz, _The Magic of Thinking Big_

This is a quote from one of the few books I'm currently reading that gives many many many tips on positive thinking, and explains how we can change to thinking BIG. Definitely recommend the book if your a reader, as this quote helps to really give an insight to the theme.

Achievers must learn to see challenges, knowing there is a solutions. This week at work see each problem others talk about, or problems you see, take a look at them through the lens of someone who thinks BIG. Find suggested solutions, and if possible run with them. It is people who do this that truly make a difference in their journey to achieve!

As always please let me know if you have any suggestions or questions about the new site. We will be making on-going changes to continuously improve.

Have a great week!!
