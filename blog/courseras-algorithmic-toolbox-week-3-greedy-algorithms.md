When solving problems, it's important to have different types of strategies that can be used to find optimal solutions. One of those strategies, Greedy Algorithms, is the topic of week 3. 

## What are Greedy Algorithms?

Greedy algorithms can be broken down into four main steps:

1. Make greedy choice
1. Prove choice is a safe choice
1. Reduce to a subproblem
1. Iterate
1. Optimize (optional if needed)
