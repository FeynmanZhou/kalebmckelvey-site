Welcome to another Wisdom of the Week post. This weekend was one full of that walk through the park, see the Roebling Bridge and murals at night, and kickback with people in Cincy weather.

Pretty wild to think that a week ago I was sick in bed, and a month + 6 days ago I was driving here. It has been a great start here, and here are some wisdom quotes that highlight the thoughts for the week.

## Wisdom quote 1:

**“Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another: ‘What! You too? I thought I was the only one.” ― C.S. Lewis**

True friendships do take time to grow from acquaintance, and those that have grown take effort to keep from atrophying. How can we make them stronger?

1. **Call don’t text** - In 2016, we text more then we talk. We should fix that by taking the time to actually call people. Since graduating college, I feel stronger in being able to realize the friendships I want to grow, and more easily recognize when not to. The people that trust me and  I can trust to have real conversations about life with. A friend of mine told me that once someone shows you who they are, believe them! I believe in believing them. Start believing them too. THIS IS A KEY PART OF BEING HAPPY IN YOUR LIFE. WHY? Because it is the people we surround ourselves with that contribute to our happiness. Call those people!!

2. **Do the little things** – There are so many little things we can do for our friends, I mean who doesn’t want an awesome, thoughtful, useful gift from a friend on their birthday? How many people wouldn’t want someone to text them in the morning and let them know they are important? How about someone who calls to see how you’re doing sometimes? These are some of the little things I personally appreciate, especially since moving away from pretty much everything I knew for 23 years.

## Wisdom quote 2:

**“Don't Sweat the Small Stuff and It's All Small Stuff” ― Richard Carlson** Last week I installed Overdrive and added the library near me as the resource, [this](http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Sweat-Small-Stuff-Its/dp/0786881852) book was offered as a free audiobook.

I’m only an hour in, and the message is so true. The best example he gave was road rage. Why would we let someone who cut in front of us ruin OUR day? The quote and title came from a story where his publisher illegally used a Foreword for one of his books without the proper consent from the note (it was used in one of his previous books).

Richard sent the famous author an apologetic letter, preparing for legal ramifications, and the famous author responded with the quote above. I found it very much true, and something I look to incorporate into my life going forward…most of the stress we have…SMALL STUFF. How can we work on this together?

1. **Take a deep breath** – If you feel the sweat on some small stuff happening, take a deep breath…count to 10, relax. My favorite one!

2. **Mindfulness Meditation** – Our mind has thoughts running through it alllllllll day, mindful meditation helps to teach our mind to focus in the present. Headspace is my favorite app, 10 free walk through meditations and a few animations to teach us the concepts.

3. **Be grateful** – Write 3 things your grateful for every night before you go to bed. Notebook, Evernote, Onenote. It all works!

Overall it’s been a great month small stuff considered. I’ve met some new people, realized those who are important to me are still very important to me, and did my best at calling some of them. I’m grateful for Amoxicillin helping me get over being sick. I’m back in action, let’s kick butt in March!!

S.N. - For any other geeks out there, I hope you were able to in some shape or form take advantage of the twitch sessions and reminiscing on Pokemon as it celebrated its 20th birthday (Charizard is still my favorite LOL).

Have a great week all!!
