Computers. Machines created to do the bidding of thy masters, without questions, without reasons. Sounds great right? It absolutely is! Technology has vastly transformed the world we live in and improved the overall living standard throughout its short history. 

This has been possible not because computers are incredibly smart (at this time), but because of the humans who tell computers what and how to do a task. When you truly think about how programming works and the field it has evolved into, there are a few basic elements that make it possible for us humans to tell computers what to do. One type of those elements is called a *data structure*.

Data structures are a building block to the software we write. They let us organize data in a computer for specific situations, so computers can do our bidding faster or make it easier for us to reason about. There are many different types of data structures with pros and cons in different scenarios, but my goal of this blog post is to write about each one in a way that makes it easy to understand for those interested. I won't be writing about every single data structure out there, but many of them are based on these fundamental ones or a combination of them, all making it easier for humans and computers to create better software!

TODO --- explain memory in a computer

# Arrays

Arrays are collections of items, typically of the same type, that are stored continuously in a block of memory. More specifically, an array is initialized to a specific size, memory for that size is allocated, and then items are added up in different indexes of the array up to that size. 

Arrays hold the same type of data because it's easier to allocate memory when that is the case. For example, if you have an array of size 4, with the type of integer in Java, then the computer can allocate 4 bytes (1 byte for each integer) in memory for you.
